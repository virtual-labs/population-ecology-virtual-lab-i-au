* Objective
  - To simulate the Interspecific Competition and Geographic Distributions experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/population-ecology-virtual-lab-i-au/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Interspecific Competition and Geographic Distributions/Interspecific Competition and Geographic Distributions_01_Usability_smk.org][Interspecific Competition and Geographic Distributions_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Give the values for the Position along gradient(x) starting value:1,Fraction:10,Ending value:1000,abh of sp1: 0.8 and ahb of sp2: 0.6 of the variable box using the sroll bar and click on the reset button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk charactersthe 
  4. It should redirect to the intial page
