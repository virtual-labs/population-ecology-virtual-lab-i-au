* Objective
  - To simulate the Metapopulation Dynamics experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/population-ecology-virtual-lab-i-au/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Metapopulation Dynamics/Metapopulation Dynamics_01_Usability_smk.org][Metapopulation Dynamics_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Select a model from the dropdown list present in the variables box
  6. Enter  the values in the Total number of patches present in the habitat(h),Rate at which occupied patch produce colonies(c),Initial number of occupied patches(p0),Rate at which occupied patch goes extinct(e) and Number of years(t) of the variable box.
  7. Click on run iteration and play and pause buttons frequently.
  8. To know the information about the statistics and dataplots click on the statistics and dataplots buttons respectively.
  9. To restart the simulation process click on the reset button.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk charactersthe 
  4. Result should be displayed on the screen
  5. It should redirect to the intial page
